- it's a good theory, if the abstraction can hold

- but it's a lot of work to make it seemless

- i'd outsource it for sure, but i wouldn't want to spend my life in proprietary guts of dying software

- i imagine a dynamic environment where photoshop is not needed

- where design happens by itself - it already does..

- see how compositions with default groups + default stacks + default styles

already produce a barebone design

- which needs just minimal tweakings... and overal visual style could be abstracted away much further than we have right now

- so design would be just right choices

- as it actually is

- it's not about drawing anymore

- but working with spectrum

- baking up a possibility tree should be main task, and the whole tree should be explorable

- photoshop stuff is old thinking, we're quickly progressing past the mundane shit

- I think design system experience can be manifold better

- and deeper

- and richer

- we're not producing styles, we're exploring design together, using code

(edited)

- imagine a 4yo designer

- producing websites looking better than a team of nerds would ever do
